    "Given that you know the size of the table from the previous query, **write a query that retrieves 5 tuples on expectation using the `BERNOULLI` sampling method.** That is, if we run the query multiple times, we should get 5 tuples on *average* in our resulting table. The `BERNOULLI` sampling method scans the whole table and selects individual rows independently with `p%` probability. Please see the [course notes on sampling](https://data101.org/notes/1-SQL/truncation.html#sampling) for syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "* Assign `p_1c` to a sampling rate that you pass into the `query_1c` f-string using Python variable substitution. Your formula should contain `count_1b`, which is the number of rows in the table. Don't forget to express `p_1c` in units of percent, i.e., if you want to assign it to a value of 3%, you should do `p_1c = 3` not `p_1c = 0.03`\n",
    "* For a refresher on f-strings and Python variable substitution, see [this tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/formatted-string-literals-f-strings-python/). If Python variable substitution is done correctly, we should be able to change our `p%` probability by simply reassigning `p_1c` and rerunning the query. (Please leave `p_1c` unchanged.)\n",
    "* We have completed the SQL line magic for you; this references the Python f-string `query_1c` you created within a SQL query using JupySQL-specific syntax.\n",
    "* Try running the SQL cell many times and see what you notice."

    "## Question 2a: MPAA Rating and `info_type`\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, using the `info_type` table, write a query to find which `id` corresponds to a film's MPAA rating.  The query `result_2a` that you write should return a relation with exactly one row and two attributes; the lone value in the instance should be the MPAA rating id number. In other words, your output table should look like this:\n",

    "- Open the `psql` client in a terminal to explore the schema of `info_type` via the `\\d` metacommand (see the [Assignment Tips](https://data101.org/fa24/assignment-tips/) page).\n",
    "- Remember you can also write SQL commands to that terminal to interact with the IMDB database, but all final work must be submitted through this Jupyter Notebook. We recommend selecting everything from the `info_type` table to see what the data looks like. Which row corresponds to the MPAA rating?\n",
    "- Be careful when using quotes. SQL interprets single and double quotes differently. The single quote character `'` is reserved for delimiting string constants, while the double quote `\"` is used for naming tables or columns that require special characters. See the [Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-STRINGS) for more."

Take a look at the schema of the relations you are working with, whether in terminal or by referring to the description at the top of the notebook. Ensure both fields reference the same entity. For example, `movie_info_sample.id` does **NOT** refer to the same entity as `movie_sample.id`.\n",

    "The manner we limited our dataset is probably the reason for the existence of negative profit numbers, such as \"102 Dalmatians\" seeming to lose $18M while being a blockbuster movie. The fact that we only considered domestic (USA) gross earnings—not foreign revenue—is a huge problem that might have a big influence on overall profitability. Furthermore, when we just chose the largest value, the way profits are recorded in the dataset—possibly as incremental amounts across many periods—may have resulted in inaccurate or incomplete revenue statistics. Another reason might be inconsistent reporting of budget data; some budgets may contain expenditures for marketing and distribution, which would make them seem greater than the real costs of production. Furthermore, our dataset only includes box office receipts; many movies make significant revenues from DVD sales, streaming, licensing, and merchandising, all of which are not included in our estimates. We should think about include both domestic and foreign profits, making sure that revenue numbers are cumulative, and confirming that budgetary figures accurately represent production costs without any extra expenses in order to increase accuracy."

The existence of high-grossing outliers is confirmed by the highest earnings (760,507,625.0), which are much greater than the median. With certain movies receiving no money at all, the wide interquartile range (IQR) of 19,339,819.0 indicates significant diversity in profits. The impact of a few very popular movies is further reinforced by the average wages (19,294,522.28), which are significantly greater than the median.
